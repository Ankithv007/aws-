# AWS Systems Manager vs. AWS Secrets Manager

## Overview

Both AWS Systems Manager and AWS Secrets Manager are services provided by AWS to help manage resources, but they serve different purposes. Here's a brief comparison of the two:

### AWS Systems Manager
AWS Systems Manager is a suite of tools that helps automate operational tasks across AWS resources. It provides insights and control over infrastructure, including instance management, patching, compliance, and automation.

Key Features:
- **Parameter Store**: Used to store configuration data and secrets, but with basic encryption using AWS KMS.
- **Automation**: Facilitates automation of tasks, such as patch management and configuration updates.
- **Run Command**: Execute remote commands on EC2 instances or other AWS resources.
- **OpsCenter**: Centralizes operational issues to help resolve incidents.
- **Compliance & Patching**: Ensures instances are compliant with policies and receive regular patches.

### AWS Secrets Manager
AWS Secrets Manager is specifically designed for managing, retrieving, and rotating secrets such as database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information. It automates the rotation of secrets and integrates with other AWS services to securely store and retrieve secrets.

Key Features:
- **Secret Rotation**: Automates the rotation of secrets without causing application downtime.
- **Encryption**: Secrets are encrypted using AWS KMS.
- **Access Control**: Granular access controls using IAM policies.
- **Auditability**: Logs access to secrets using AWS CloudTrail for security audits.
- **Automatic Updates**: Automatically updates credentials like RDS database passwords, without manual intervention.

## Main Differences
| Feature                  | AWS Systems Manager (Parameter Store)  | AWS Secrets Manager              |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Use Case**              | General purpose parameter storage, basic secrets management | Managing secrets, credentials, and key rotation |
| **Encryption**            | Optional, basic encryption with AWS KMS | Encrypted by default with AWS KMS |
| **Secret Rotation**       | Manual rotation                        | Automated secret rotation         |
| **Cost**                  | Free up to 10,000 API calls per month   | Paid service based on usage       |
| **Audit Logging**         | Basic auditing with CloudTrail          | Advanced auditing with CloudTrail |
| **Integration**           | EC2, Lambda, RDS, and other AWS services | Native integration for secrets with RDS, Redshift, etc. |
| **Access Control**        | IAM policies                           | More granular IAM policies for secrets |

### Conclusion
Use **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** if you need a lightweight, general-purpose solution for storing configurations and secrets. Opt for **AWS Secrets Manager** if you need automated secret rotation, enhanced encryption, and detailed auditing for managing sensitive data like database credentials.

# HashiCorp Vault vs. AWS Secrets Manager

## What is HashiCorp Vault? HTTP port: 8200
**HashiCorp Vault** is an open-source tool designed to securely store and manage sensitive data, such as secrets, API keys, credentials, and encryption keys. It allows organizations to control access to secrets through dynamic secrets generation, encryption, fine-grained access control, and audit logging. Vault can be used across multiple environments, including on-premises and multi-cloud.

### Key Features of HashiCorp Vault:
- **Secrets Management**: Securely store and retrieve secrets (API tokens, passwords, etc.).
- **Dynamic Secrets**: On-demand generation of secrets (e.g., database credentials) with expiration policies.
- **Encryption as a Service**: API to encrypt data without exposing encryption keys.
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained policies for managing access to secrets.
- **Audit Logging**: Tracks every request for compliance and auditing.
- **Multi-Cloud/On-Premise**: Not tied to a specific platform, works across clouds and on-premises.

## What is AWS Secrets Manager?
**AWS Secrets Manager** is a fully managed service by AWS for managing secrets, such as database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information. It simplifies secrets management by automating secret rotation, encryption, and auditing. It is primarily designed for use within the AWS ecosystem, providing seamless integration with AWS services like RDS, Lambda, and others.

### Key Features of AWS Secrets Manager:
- **Secrets Management**: Securely store and retrieve secrets within the AWS ecosystem.
- **Automated Secret Rotation**: Automatically rotate secrets, such as database passwords, without downtime.
- **Encryption**: Secrets are encrypted at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
- **Access Control**: Manage access to secrets using AWS IAM policies.
- **Audit Logging**: Integrated with AWS CloudTrail for tracking and auditing.
- **AWS Integration**: Easily integrates with AWS services such as RDS, Redshift, and Lambda.

## Key Differences Between HashiCorp Vault and AWS Secrets Manager

| Feature                   | HashiCorp Vault                               | AWS Secrets Manager                          |
