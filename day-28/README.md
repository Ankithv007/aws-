# Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)

Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a scalable, fully managed, elastic, and cloud-native file storage service designed for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It provides a simple, scalable, elastic, and fully managed file storage for use with AWS services and on-premises resources.

## Key Features of Amazon EFS
1. **Elastic and Scalable**: Automatically scales as files are added or removed.
2. **Managed Service**: Fully managed file system, requiring minimal administrative overhead.
3. **High Availability and Durability**: Data is stored redundantly across multiple availability zones (AZs).
4. **Multi-AZ Access**: Accessible from multiple AZs, enabling cross-AZ workloads.
5. **POSIX Compliance**: Compatible with POSIX applications for seamless integration.
6. **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for the storage you use.
7. **High Throughput and Low Latency**: Supports workloads with high IOPS requirements.

## Common Use Cases
- **Web serving and content management**.
- **Big data analytics**: Seamless integration with analytics frameworks.
- **Media processing**: High throughput for rendering and transcoding.
- **Backup and storage**: Centralized data storage for multiple services or applications.
- **Machine learning**: Store and serve training data sets.

## Amazon EFS Performance Modes
1. **General Purpose**: For latency-sensitive use cases like web serving.
2. **Max I/O**: For highly parallelized applications with higher IOPS needs.

### Throughput Modes
- **Bursting Throughput**: Scales automatically based on file system size.
- **Provisioned Throughput**: Configure throughput independent of storage size.

## Amazon EFS Access
1. **NFS Protocol**: Uses NFSv4 and NFSv4.1.
2. **Integration with AWS Services**: Works with EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda, and others.

## Key Components
- **Mount Targets**: Allow access to the file system in a specific VPC.
- **File System**: Central storage entity for files and directories.
- **EFS Lifecycle Management**: Moves infrequently used files to the Infrequent Access (IA) storage class.

## EFS Pricing
Amazon EFS charges based on:
1. **Storage Classes**:
   - Standard: High-performance storage.
   - Infrequent Access (IA): For less frequently accessed files.
2. **Data Transfer**: Minimal charges for data movement outside AWS regions.
3. **Provisioned Throughput** (optional): Extra charges if you enable it.

## Getting Started with Amazon EFS
### Prerequisites
- AWS account
- An EC2 instance (for mounting EFS)
- IAM permissions for EFS management

### Step 1: Create an EFS File System
1. Open the **Amazon EFS Console**.
2. Click **Create File System**.
3. Select **VPC** and **Subnets** for mount targets.
4. Configure lifecycle management and throughput settings.
5. Create the file system.

# AWS Storage Services Overview

AWS offers a variety of storage services tailored to different use cases. These services can be broadly categorized into **File Storage**, **Object Storage**, and **Block Storage**. Below, we outline what these storage types are, why they are used, and the corresponding AWS services.

---

## 1. File Storage  
### What is File Storage?  
File storage organizes data into a hierarchical structure with files and folders. It is ideal for applications requiring shared access across multiple systems and compatibility with traditional file systems like NFS or SMB.  

### Why Use File Storage?  
- Shared file system for distributed applications.
- POSIX compliance for compatibility with traditional file-based workloads.
- Easy integration with analytics and big data frameworks.  

### AWS Service: Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)  
**Amazon EFS** is a fully managed, scalable file storage service that grows and shrinks automatically with the volume of data.  

#### Key Features:
- **Elastic Scaling**: Automatically adjusts capacity.
- **Multi-AZ Access**: Ensures high availability.
- **POSIX-Compliant**: Works with applications requiring file-based storage.

#### Common Use Cases:
- Web server content sharing.
- Media processing workflows.
- Big data analytics and machine learning workloads.

## 2. Object Storage  
### What is Object Storage?  
Object storage stores data as objects, each containing metadata and a unique identifier. It is ideal for unstructured data like images, videos, backups, and logs.  

### Why Use Object Storage?  
- Cost-effective for storing large volumes of data.
- Supports metadata tagging for easy search and categorization.
- Highly durable and scalable.  

### AWS Service: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)  
**Amazon S3** is a highly durable and scalable object storage service designed for any amount of data and various use cases.  

#### Key Features:
- **11 9's Durability**: Data is redundantly stored across multiple locations.
- **Storage Classes**: Optimize costs with tiers like S3 Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, and Glacier for archival.
- **Data Lifecycle Policies**: Automate transitions between storage classes.

#### Common Use Cases:
- Website hosting and static content storage.
- Backup and disaster recovery.
- Data lakes and analytics.

#### Learn More:
- [Amazon S3 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/)

## 3. Block Storage  
### What is Block Storage?  
Block storage breaks data into fixed-size blocks and is ideal for databases, operating systems, and applications requiring high performance and low latency.  

### Why Use Block Storage?  
- High performance for databases and transactional applications.
- Low latency for high IOPS workloads.
- Persistent storage for EC2 instances.  

### AWS Service: Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)  
**Amazon EBS** provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. It is designed for high-performance, low-latency workloads.  

#### Key Features:
- **Multiple Volume Types**: Choose from SSD (gp3, io2) or HDD (st1, sc1) based on workload needs.
- **Snapshots**: Backup data with incremental snapshots.
- **Encryption**: Protect data at rest using AWS KMS.

#### Common Use Cases:
- Relational and non-relational databases.
- Transactional systems and enterprise applications.
- Log and boot volumes for EC2 instances.
